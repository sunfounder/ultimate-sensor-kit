Video 4: Variables, Data Types, and Constants
===============================================

This tutorial dives into the essentials of using variables, data types, constants, and preprocessor directives in Arduino programming, demonstrated through a traffic light simulation.

* **Variables in Arduino**: Demonstrates how to use variables for dynamic programming in Arduino.
* **Data Types**: Explains various data types like ``int``, ``float``, ``double``, ``char``, ``bool``, and their memory usage.
* **Efficient Memory Usage**: Highlights the significance of selecting appropriate data types for efficient memory management in microcontrollers.
* ``const`` **and**  ``#define``: Discusses the use of constants and preprocessor directives for creating fixed values in code.
* **Traffic Light Simulation**: Guides through building and programming a traffic light simulation to apply these concepts.
